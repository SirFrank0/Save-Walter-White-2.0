        My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br/>
		found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen<br/>
		soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br/>
		Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind<br/>
		of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are<br/>
		just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you<br/>
		to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br/>
		try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br/>
		day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br/>
		"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br/>
		crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since<br/>
		Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the<br/>
		near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.

        Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally<br/>
        hate that question) or nags me about coming home on time at <br/>
        night and being responsible. One day he won't be here to ask. Now <br/>
        I feel lucky when I hear his car pulling into the driveway after <br/>
        school. I even like to hear him coughing It means he's still around.<br/>
        Still my dad.
